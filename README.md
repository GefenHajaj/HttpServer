# HttpServer
A simple HTTP server

# What to do to run the server?

The files you should work with are:
http_server.py,
HttpServer.py,
GeneralServer.py,
Constants.py.

Just clone the intire repository...

Set the PORT and IP address, as well as ROOT_DIR in Constants.py and run http_server.py.
Surf to IP:PORT and see your website!

YAY!

Note:
If you don't want to use the server for the given site, the server should work with any other website with the file types that are supported - according to the code (see the main note at top of main file 'http_server.py").
