# HttpServer
A simple HTTP server

#What do do to run the server?
You should have the files provided by Gvahim site - if you don't so the server should work with any other website with the file types that are supported - according to the code (see the main note at top of main file 'http_server.py".

Set the PORT and IP address in Constants.py and run http_server.py.
